This is currently a test to see how minimally the satRdays website can be rebuilt using bootstrap 5 from the ground up in a clean environment

## Motivation

The satRdays website was built from existing hugo themes using bootstrap 3 with extensive themeing customisation by the original theme creators and then incrementally extended by Dave and a bunch of other users to create something we weren't ontop of. 

## Goal

To see if a minimally viable website can be made with bootstrap 5 that is lighter weight, easier to maintain, with better accessibility and less of a turn off to new contributors.
